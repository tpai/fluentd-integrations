# AGENTS.md — Coding Agent Guidelines

This file documents conventions for coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.) working in this repository.

## Repository Overview

A collection of self-contained Docker Compose examples showing how to ship logs from a containerized app (nginx) through Fluentd to a downstream log aggregation backend. Each example lives in its own top-level directory.

```
<backend>/
  docker-compose.yml          # full stack definition
  fluentd/
    Dockerfile                # extends fluent/fluentd base, installs plugin
    fluent.conf               # Fluentd pipeline config
  README.md
  screenshot.png
```

Current backends: `elasticsearch`, `loki`, `opensearch`, `splunk-hec`.

---

## Adding a New Backend Example

Follow this checklist exactly — every example must be structurally identical so a reader can diff them mentally.

1. Create `<backend>/docker-compose.yml`
2. Create `<backend>/fluentd/Dockerfile`
3. Create `<backend>/fluentd/fluent.conf`
4. Create `<backend>/README.md`
5. Add an entry to the root `README.md` under **Available Examples**

Do not skip any of these files. Do not add extra files unless the backend genuinely requires them (e.g., a provisioning config that cannot be inlined).

## Naming Conventions

| Thing | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Top-level directory | `kebab-case`, lowercase, matches the plugin/product name | `splunk-hec`, `opensearch` |
| `container_name` in Compose | match the service role, lowercase, no prefix | `fluentd`, `elasticsearch`, `kibana` |
| Fluentd log tags | `<category>.<sub>` dot-notation | `httpd.access`, `app.error` |
| Environment variables | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `LOKI_URL`, `SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN` |
| Compose named volumes | `<backend>-data` | `elasticsearch-data`, `opensearch-data` |
| Index / dataset names | lowercase, singular or product-default | `logs`, `main` |

---

## fluent.conf Conventions

Every `fluent.conf` must follow this exact section order:

```
1. <source> forward    (port 24224)
2. <source> http       (port 9880)
3. <match fluent.**>   stdout (Fluentd internal logs)
4. <match *.**>        copy → <store> destination + <store> stdout
```

Rules:
- Always include both `forward` and `http` sources — they are the two standard ingestion paths.
- Always mirror logs to `stdout` inside a `<store>` block so `docker compose logs fluentd` is useful during development.
- Use `flush_interval 5s` for all output plugins unless the backend has a documented reason to differ.
- Set `include_tag_key true` on every output plugin.
- Prefer `include_timestamp true` over relying on the backend to infer time.
- Read secrets (tokens, passwords) from environment variables using `"#{ENV['VAR']}"` — never hardcode credentials in `fluent.conf`.
- Keep inline comments to a minimum; only annotate non-obvious flags (e.g., `verify_es_version_at_startup false # disable version check`).

---

## Dockerfile Conventions

```dockerfile
FROM fluent/fluentd:v1.19-2      # pin the base tag; do not use :latest
USER root
# <Backend> plugin
RUN gem install <dependency>      # only if a gem dependency is required first
RUN gem install fluent-plugin-<name>
USER fluent                       # always drop back to fluent user
```

Rules:
- Pin the base image tag (`v1.19-2`, not `latest`). Current latest: `v1.19-2` (= `v1.19.2-2.3`, updated 2026-05-01).
- One `RUN gem install` per gem — do not chain with `&&` unless order matters.
- Drop privileges back to `USER fluent` as the last instruction.
- The single comment above the install block names the backend (`# Elasticsearch plugin`) — keep it.
- Do not pin plugin gem versions in `gem install` unless a specific version is required for server compatibility (e.g., `elasticsearch -v "~> 8.0"` to match an ES 8.x server). Installing without a version pin pulls the latest release.
- Before upgrading the base image to a new minor/major version, verify all installed gems are compatible with the new Fluentd Ruby runtime (`gem list` in a test build is the fastest check).

### Plugin version compatibility (as of 2026-05-10)

| Plugin | Latest | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fluent-plugin-elasticsearch` | 6.0.0 | Requires `elasticsearch ~> 8.0` client for ES 8.x servers. Options `verify_es_version_at_startup` and `default_elasticsearch_version` still valid. |
| `fluent-plugin-grafana-loki` | 1.3.0 | No known compatibility issues with Fluentd 1.19.x. |
| `fluent-plugin-opensearch` | 1.1.5 | **`type_name` config option removed.** Use `suppress_type_name true` if needed. Plugin auto-suppresses types for OpenSearch ≥ 2.x. |
| `fluent-plugin-splunk-hec` | 1.3.3 | Requires `json-jwt ~> 1.15.0`; RubyGems resolves this correctly. |

## docker-compose.yml Conventions

- Service order: `app` → `fluentd` → backend service(s) → UI/dashboard service.
- The demo app is always `image: nginx:alpine` tagged `demo-app`.
- Fluentd logging driver on `app`:
  ```yaml
  logging:
    driver: "fluentd"
    options:
      fluentd-address: localhost:24224
      tag: httpd.access
  ```
- Fluentd service always mounts `./fluentd:/fluentd` and runs with `-c /fluentd/fluent.conf -v`.
- Secrets that must differ per deployment go in `environment:` on the `fluentd` service and are read in `fluent.conf` via `ENV`.
- Named volumes are declared at the top-level `volumes:` block — do not use anonymous volumes.
- Specify `platform: linux/arm64` only when the upstream image requires it (e.g., Elasticsearch, OpenSearch on Apple Silicon). Do not add `platform` for images that publish multi-arch manifests.
- Pin backend images to a specific version tag — do not use `:latest` for stateful services.

## Ports Reference

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| app (nginx) | 8080 | HTTP demo traffic |
| fluentd | 24224 | Forward input (Docker logging driver) |
| fluentd | 9880 | HTTP input (curl / test payloads) |
| Elasticsearch / OpenSearch | 9200 | REST API |
| Kibana / OpenSearch Dashboards | 5601 | Web UI |
| Loki | 3100 | HTTP API |
| Grafana | 3000 | Web UI |
| Splunk web | 8000 | Web UI |
| Splunk HEC | 8088 | HTTP Event Collector |

Do not remap these ports unless there is a documented conflict. Consistency lets readers run multiple examples and compare them.

---

## README.md Conventions (per example)

Each `<backend>/README.md` should cover, in order:

1. One-sentence description of what the example does.
2. Prerequisites (Docker, Docker Compose).
3. `docker compose up --build -d` start command.
4. How to verify logs are flowing (UI URL or curl command).
5. `docker compose down -v` teardown command.
6. A screenshot embedded as `![screenshot](./screenshot.png)`.

Keep it short. Do not duplicate configuration details that are already visible in the config files.

---

## What Agents Should NOT Do

- Do not refactor shared logic into a common base — each example is intentionally self-contained and copy-paste portable.
- Do not add health checks, resource limits, or production-hardening to the Compose files unless the user explicitly asks; these are demo stacks.
- Do not add `.env` files for secrets — the pattern is environment variables declared inline in `docker-compose.yml` with obvious placeholder values, so the example is runnable out of the box.
- Do not change `flush_interval` below `5s` — shorter intervals cause excessive write amplification in single-node demo deployments.
- Do not upgrade the Fluentd base image without verifying the target plugin is compatible with the new version.
